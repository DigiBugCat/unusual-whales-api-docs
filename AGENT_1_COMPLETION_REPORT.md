- Numeric values are properly formatted
- Nested objects contain expected metadata

### API Characteristics
- All endpoints use HTTP GET method

## Validation Methodology

### Testing Approach
1. Live API calls to each endpoint using Python requests library
2. Verification of 200 OK response status
3. JSON response validation
4. Sample data extraction for documentation

### Test Parameters Used
- `limit=10` for list endpoints where applicable
- `ticker=AAPL` for ticker-specific endpoints
- Default behavior tested when no parameters required

### Response Analysis
- First item from each response used as example
- Real data preserved to show actual API behavior
- Response structure documented with field descriptions

---

## Recommendations

### For API Users
1. Always handle the 401 Unauthorized response for invalid API keys
2. Be aware of the 14-day lookback limit on alerts filtering
3. Use pagination (limit parameter) for efficient data retrieval
4. Monitor response headers for rate limiting information

### For API Maintainers
1. Consider adding more detailed parameter descriptions in OpenAPI spec
2. Document rate limit headers in responses
3. Provide example values for date parameters in some endpoints
4. Consider adding response example objects to OpenAPI specification

### For Documentation
1. All endpoints properly documented with real examples
2. Template format is comprehensive and developer-friendly
3. Code examples in multiple languages (curl, Python, JavaScript)
4. Response examples are from actual API calls (not mocked)
